There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## CrowdComputing ##
  > Kickstarter, but you donate computing power instead of money

## Donate computing power ##
  > Engaged samaritans who want to donate their computer's free computing power to charitable/scientific causes

## Summary ##
  > So you know Kickstarter? That site where you give money to cool projects? Well, our product lets you donate COMPUTING POWER to cool projects. You simply download our software, select which project you want to donate to, set your preferences for how much and when your computer will donate its computing power, and you're done! Want to help Stanford analyze protein folding? Want to help SETI analyze signals for possible extraterrestial life forms? Want to help the CDC track and predict the spread of Ebola? Then use our product!

## Problem ##
  > For Researchers: Many scientific problems require immense computing power, but they don't have access to the kind of datacenters and supercomputers that Google does. 
  For Users: Traditional charities get lots of attention and donations, but longer-term scientific research projects don't. Many users want to help these projects, but have few avenues to do so.
## Solution ##
  > CrowdComputing! Connect engaged samaritans with smart researchers. This is going to cure Cancer! and AIDS! and World Hunger! 

## Quote from You ##
  > "Man I wish my computer could do bigger things!! I always wanted my computer to contribute to the greater good. I have a super fast computer and I only use it for 5 or 6 hours a day" - Ralph

## How to Get Started ##
  > One click!. lol, no. It's actually pretty complicated, but never fear, gentle user! we will guide you through the barren landscape of distributed computing and make the whole process easy. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Can I stream porn on this?" - Kevin

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Help us cure Cancer! What, you won't help us? Well you're a really shitty person then. Seriously, who doesn't want to cure Cancer?
